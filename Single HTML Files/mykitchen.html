		<h1>Vegetarian Kitchen</h1>
			<p>As Americans, meat tends to take up a large portion of the food we eat everyday. When you cut that out, it can be tricky to maintain a diet that isn't the same foods over and over again. I've come up with a few quick and easy things to make on the regular, without feeling bored with my diet.
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Breakfast foods</th>
				<th>Smoothie Bowls</th>
				<th>Vegetarian Chili</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><center>Breakfast is by far my favorite meal, and the one that is least impacted by going meat-less. My Sunday morning breakfast meals could include anything from French toast, eggs, cut up fruit, hash browns, and so on. This is my favorite meal to play around with, and is the easiest to find meat-less alternative for. (I'm not a huge fan of meat substitutes, but they're there if you need them!)</center></td>
				<td><center>Smoothie bowls have become a quick favorite of mine, and are incredibly versatile! Working off of whatever base that's made, you can add things like granola, banana, peanut butter, chocolate syrup, etc to make it your own! These are easy to make low calorie as well. Having some frozen fruit on hand, and fresh fruit when available, smoothie bowls are a quick treat! </center></td>
				<td><center>I like to meal prep my dinners a week at a time, and vegetarian chili is one of my favorites. It only takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and you can back in a lot of vegetables and beans to get your nutritional value! I've made it with and without meat-less crumbles, and I personally think it is good either way.</center></td>
